02:05 < multi_io> MatthiasM: are you there?
02:09 < multi_io> MatthiasM: is there a problem with displaying a TWL UI in an AWTGLCanvas and thus run all the 
                  redraws from the canvas's paintGL() method?
02:10 < MatthiasM> I would say no :)
02:11 < multi_io> (i.e. call UI#update() from there)
02:11 < multi_io> ok\
02:14 <+lwjglbot> nightly: LWJGL #533 (SUCCESS) <http://www.newdawnsoftware.com/hudson/job/LWJGL/533/> || 
                  LWJGL-win32 #549 (SUCCESS) <http://www.newdawnsoftware.com/hudson/job/LWJGL-win32/549/>
02:15 < multi_io> if I were to create two AWTGLCanvas objects (in two different windows) and have them share theire 
                  GL contexts, and then draw a TWL GUI in each of them, would that lead to problems?
02:16 < MatthiasM> you can create as many GUI instances as you want
02:16 < MatthiasM> eg the theme editor uses 2 in one GL context :)
02:17 < multi_io> would they end up sharing things like TWL-internal textures automatically then?
02:18 < MatthiasM> no - this is controlled by Renderer instances and it's CacheContext objects
02:18 < multi_io> ah, ok
02:19 < multi_io> but I really want to have two separate X11 windows with a GUI in each of them
02:19 < multi_io> but that should be possible, right?
02:19 < MatthiasM> and?
02:19 < MatthiasM> yes
02:19 < multi_io> ok
02:20 < multi_io> thanks, I'll try this out

01:01 < multi_io> looks like I can't use TWL with AWTGLCanvas because the latter doesn't create a Display and thus I 
                  get a "Mouse must be created" exception in the LWJGLRenderer constructor.
01:01 < multi_io> MatthiasM: ^^^
01:01 < NoobFukaire1> Mouse.create()?

01:04 < appel> is matt around?
01:12 < multi_io> what I want is run TWL in an AWT canvas. The GL routines (and thus, the TWL calls) should be issued in the AWT event dispatch thread

Possible at all? :-\

CanvasGameContainer from the "Slick" library
(http://slick.cokeandcode.com/) may achieve something like what I want
-- investigate!

16:14 < multi_io> I don't know if this is related, but I want to use TWL in an AWTGLCanvas or maybe in a normal Canvas with 
                  Display.setParent, but I want the TWL event handlers to be called in the AWT event dispatch thread
16:14 < multi_io> i.e. I don't want to have a separate rendering thread
16:14 < multi_io> (this is an AWT/Swing app, obviously)
16:16 < multi_io> using AWTGLCanvas directly doesn't work here because AWTGLCanvas doesn't create a Display and I get a "Mouse must be 
                  created" exception in the LWJGLRenderer constructor.
16:18 < multi_io> MatthiasM2: so AWTGLCanvas isn't really supported by TWL?
16:19 < kap1> Phiip be great if you can drop a patch of the needed change on the lwjgl forum
16:19 < kap1> i'm sure someone will review it and add it to lwjgl

16:43 < baedert> multi_io: did you use Display.setParent()?
16:44 < baedert> there's also the theme editor which is using a awt frame to be resizable and the code is online

16:53 < multi_io> baedert: Yes, I use Display.setParent()
16:53 < multi_io> (unless I use AWTGLCanvas)
16:53 < multi_io> thanks for the link
16:56 < MatthiasM2> multi_io: it is - you just can't use GUI.update() direct√∂y

18:06 < multi_io> MatthiasM2: ok, so I would directly call things like handleMouse(x,y,...), handleKey(...) from outside, passing e.g. 
                  mouse events into TWL?
18:06 < MatthiasM2> yes
18:08 < multi_io> cool
18:32 < MatthiasM2> multi_io: look at the Slick <-> TWL adapter for details
18:32 < MatthiasM2> maybe you could put your AWTGLCanvas adapter online too?

20:03 < multi_io> MatthiasM2: I would still need to Display.create(theAWTGLCanvas) though, right?
20:03 < MatthiasM2> huh?
20:03 < MatthiasM2> when you use AWTGLCanvas you don't use any of the Display/Mouse/Keyboard classes
20:04 < multi_io> right, thought so
20:04 < multi_io> but
20:04 < MatthiasM2> (except for the Keyboard constants - they are used by TWL)
20:04 < multi_io> the LWJGLRender c'tor needs Mouse.getCursorSize() or so
20:04 < multi_io> *LWJGLRenderer
20:04 < MatthiasM2> hmm
20:05 < MatthiasM2> yeah - but that shouldn't matter
20:06 < multi_io> ok
20:06 < multi_io> seems to work
20:08 < multi_io> no
20:08 < multi_io>  java.lang.IllegalStateException: Mouse must be created.
20:09 < multi_io> at org.lwjgl.input.Cursor.getMinCursorSize(Cursor.java:121)
20:09 < multi_io> ..and Mouse.create() wants a display, iirc
20:11 < MatthiasM2> multi_io: ok, try the latest version from mercurial repo

20:24 < multi_io> MatthiasM2: thanks
20:24 < multi_io> I think Gui#setCursor is the other thing that uses Mouse
20:24 < multi_io> ?
20:25 < multi_io> so it just wouldn't be supported with AWTGLCanvas then?
20:27 < multi_io> and GUI#draw doesn't draw anything here for now, but that's probably some fault in my code (investigating)

20:37 < multi_io> ok
